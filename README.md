# Netflix Clone - MERN Stack
Welcome to my Netflix Clone project, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js)! This project is based on an amazing tutorial by As A Programmer! His tutorial was clear, well-structured, and incredibly helpful, guiding me through the process of creating a fully functional Netflix-like web app.

You can check out the tutorial here: [Watch on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/gRroBZczKAU?si=e4PoA0eeEQLHKnBB)
